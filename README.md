Who is the program for?

"" This program is made for people who enjoy tanning outdoors and want to do it safely and effectively. Whether you’re sunbathing at the beach or catching rays in your backyard, this app helps you find the best time to tan without overexposing your skin. ""


What does the program do? 
""The app automatically checks the current UV index from real-time weather data or a UV sensor. It helps users decide if it's a good time to tan and provides safety advice based on UV strength. Instead of guessing or constantly checking weather sites, this app tells you when the UV is ideal and when it’s too risky, helping prevent burns.""
